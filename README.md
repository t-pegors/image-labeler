# image-labeler

A quick and easy way to assign binary labels to image files. Labels are stored in a "labels.csv" file within the image folder. Each column is a label category. Labels are either 1 (key "f") or 0 (key "j"). 

Give this class a folder location with all your images, and use the class methods to add, delete, edit, and append labels.  (for ML classification or general "Did I find what I was looking for?" questions.)
